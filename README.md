# nlp_projects

This repository contains small NLP projects that I've done. Below is a brief explanation of each project:

## Logistic Regression for Text Classification
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for text classification tasks. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. The notebook [log_reg.ipynb](log_reg.ipynb) walks through the steps of building and evaluating the model.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This project focuses on Named Entity Recognition using a pre-trained BERT model. It includes data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation on a German language dataset. The notebook [ner.ipynb](ner.ipynb) provides a detailed implementation and analysis of the NER model.

## Word Embeddings
This project explores word embeddings using Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) models. It includes training embeddings on different datasets and comparing their performance. The notebook [wordembeddings.ipynb](wordembeddings.ipynb) covers the training process and evaluation of the embeddings.

## Simple Neural Network
This project implements a simple neural network for text classification. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebook [simple_nn.ipynb](simple_nn.ipynb) demonstrates the implementation and results of the neural network model.

## Prompt Engineering Part 1 & 2
These projects cover various techniques and strategies for prompt engineering in NLP tasks. They include examples and experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of different prompts. The notebooks [promt_eng_part1.ipynb](promt_eng_part1.ipynb) and [promt_eng_part2.ipynb](promt_eng_part2.ipynb) provide detailed insights and results from the experiments.
